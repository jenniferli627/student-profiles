Part 1
The first step of the assignment is to fetch data from this public JSON API, and present
the information on the screen. The route to fetch the data is:
method: GET
url: https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/students
You do not need any credentials to access the URL above. It should also have CORS set
up, so you should be able to access the data from the browser.
The goal of this part is to present the data on the screen. Do not worry about styling as
you will be doing that in a future step.

Part 2
The second step of the assignment is to style the web page. Replicate the style of the
image and gif below as best as you can. The font used in the image is Raleway. Please
also make the page mobile responsive, so that it works on screens of all sizes.

Part 3
In this part, you are going to add a text input, where a user can filter the list of students
by their name (including full name!). Below are a few images of what this should look
like. 

Part 4
In this part, you are going to make each student have an expandable list view, so that all
of their test scores may be viewed. 
Required: the plus should be an HTML button, and if the button is clicked on, the
expansion will toggle

Part 5
Finally, you will add a text input field to add tags for a specific student. Here is what it
looks like (adding a tag called “new tag”)

You will then add another search bar to search for students based on tags. A strong
submission will have this functionality:
● If a name is entered in the search by name input, and a tag is entered in the
search by tag input, results that include both the name and tag should be shown.

The next page contains an example of filtering by tag and name at the same time as
well as submission instructions.
